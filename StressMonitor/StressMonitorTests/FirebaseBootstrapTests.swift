/// Regression gate for the CI provisioning path. `GoogleService-Info.plist` is

/// unconfigured — anonymous auth, AI Chat, credits, the IAP grant, and Google
/// Sign-In all dead with no build-time signal. Pinning
/// `FirebaseBootstrap.state` in the test host turns that class of failure into
/// a red test instead of a dead TestFlight build.
///
/// The `.configured` assertions premise the plist's presence in the test host.
/// CI does not provision the file (its provisioning was deliberately deferred
/// when this suite landed), so on a clean CI checkout they are disabled with
/// an explicit reason — the gate re-arms automatically wherever the file
/// exists (local dev machines, or a future CI that provisions the file;
/// the deferred plan lives in
/// .planning/quick/260829-kby-provision-googleservice-info-plist-in-ci).
